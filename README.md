vimfiles
========

This is my current Vim configuration.  It's intended to be reusable by anyone, but is currently in a hacky state.

In addition to the plugins below, there's a heavily-modified tabline styled after vim-powerline.  My intention is to split the modifications off into a separate plugin when it's complete.

Contents

Plugins are Git submodules, except for pathogen.

If the author maintains a GitHub account, their repository is used.  If not,
the [vim-scripts](https://github.com/vim-scripts) version is used.  If
neither of those exist, the files are included directly in this repository.
