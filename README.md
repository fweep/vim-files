vim-files
========

This is my current Vim configuration.  Uses Solarized (dark).  Plugins
are primarily targeted at Python, Rails and Vimscript development.
Mostly Python these days, so the others may be stale.

I've recently switched to neovim, and have extracted my shared
vim/neovim config to
[fweep/vim-shared](https://github.com/fweep/vim-shared). My neovim
config is also available as
[fweep/neovim-files](https://github.com/fweep/neovim-files).

Requirements
------------

* Font patched for [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline.git).
* [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) terminal.

Contents
--------

The plugin list was usually out-of-date, so look at the vimrc file for
details.  It's well-commented.

Notes
-----

If the author maintains a GitHub account, their repository is used.  If not,
the [vim-scripts](https://github.com/vim-scripts) version is used.  If
neither of those exist, the files are included directly in this repository.
